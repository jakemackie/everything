# Everything

### What are my goals with this project?
Everything to build your next *big thing* should be ready for you, and completely open source. With this, performance, developer experience and other factors shouldn't compromise. I want to build this with attention to detail of every potential obstacle developers run into when creating large-scale apps, then have that large-scale app deploy cross-platform. I'm proposing a one-fix-all solution that's free to use.
